   # Data Analysis Project
## Data Extraction, Processing, and Transformation
This project encompasses three types of problems in three distinct datasets: Adult, Beijing Air, and Solar Flare. Below are the various difficulties presented by each dataset, the steps, and procedures needed to convert the provided data into usable DataFrames (df). Additionally, after obtaining the dfs, data preparation was performed for later analysis.

### Introduction
This project aims to extract, process, and transform data from different datasets for subsequent analysis. Each dataset presents unique challenges that must be addressed to obtain clean and structured data.

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:
    - Python 3.x
    - Python libraries: pandas, numpy, re, zipfile, os
### Datasets
#### 1. *Adult* Dataset
The Adult dataset includes two text files (data and names).
Steps:
1. Read the names file:
    - Use regular expressions to extract the necessary information due to the extensive length of the file.
    - Parse the file to obtain the column names.
2. Read the data file:
    - Use the column names obtained from the names file.
    - Create a DataFrame with the data.

#### 2. *Beijing Air Quality* Dataset
The Beijing Air Quality dataset is in a compressed (.zip) file that needs to be downloaded and decompressed before processing.
Steps:
1. Download and decompress the .zip file:
    - Use Python commands to download and decompress the file.
2. Read and concatenate the data files:
    - Iterate over the decompressed files and concatenate them into a single DataFrame.

#### 3. *Solar Flare* Dataset
For the Solar Flare dataset, we have two data files (Data 1 and Data 2) and a descriptive file that contains the variable names. The variable names are accessed using regular expressions.
Steps:
1. Read the descriptive file:
    - Use regular expressions to extract the variable names.
2. Read the data files:
    - Use the extracted variable names to create DataFrames, combining the two data files.

### Data Preparation and Cleaning
After converting the data into DataFrames, the following preparation and cleaning steps were performed:

    - Removing null values: Null or missing values were removed or replaced.
    - Data type conversion: Ensured appropriate data types for each column.
